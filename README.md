# axum-realworld

Very early WIP

The goal of this project is to combine some of the modular-monolith/vertical slice architecture/event driven architecture patterns I've developed in Rust with the patterns established by https://github.com/meysamhadeli/booking-modular-monolith/, as well as some of what is discussed by https://codeopinion.com/.
